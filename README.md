# MIT-Hackathon

In this hackathon, we had given a problem statement on which we have to work on for straight 30 hours. We had developed Android app with Firebase as backend. 
We participated as ThreeBugs Team. Team members are Santoshkumar Vijapure, Swapnil Gaware.
We tried to implement all features as possible as we can. Hackathons are always good. They teach to build working prototypes within time constraints. 
They teach learn to work in teams. They learn to brainstorms. They learn about prioritizing features.
